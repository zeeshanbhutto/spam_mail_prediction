# Spam Mail Detection Using Logistic Regression

**Description:**
This project aims to detect spam emails using a logistic regression model. The model is trained on a dataset of labeled emails.

**Technologies:**
* Python
* NumPy
* Pandas
* Scikit-learn

**Data Preprocessing:**
1. Clean the email data by removing stop words, punctuation, and HTML tags.
2. Convert text to numerical features using TF-IDF.

**Model Development:**
1. Train a logistic regression model on the preprocessed data.
2. Tune hyperparameters (e.g., regularization strength) to optimize performance.

**Evaluation:**
The model achieved an accuracy of 95% on the test set.

**Usage:**
1. Clone this repository.
2. Prepare your email data in a CSV format.
3. Run the `main.py` script.

**Future Work:**
Consider exploring deep learning models like recurrent neural networks for improved performance.
